## 1. Question
ultrathing hard about this problem. How can i use this repo to train a clip model to get a map with the given embeddings based an isaacsim environment. I dont know exactly how i could train it because I dont have any labeled maps.  

## 1. Answere
Short answer: you don’t need to train CLIP to use VLMaps. This repo builds a map by fusing features from a pretrained CLIP/LSeg pipeline into a 3D grid and then indexes that map with text queries (zero-shot). You can use Isaac Sim to collect RGB-D + poses, convert them into VLMaps’ “custom dataset” format, and then run the provided mapping + indexing scripts. No labeled maps are required.

#### What VLMaps actually does
- It loads a pretrained CLIP model (see vlmaps/map/clip_map.py: _init_clip) and extracts text embeddings for your category prompts (load_categories). It computes similarity between text embeddings and the fused per-voxel visual features to get masks, thresholded per-class (95th percentile by default), i.e., no labels needed.
- It uses LSeg (a language-driven segmentation model aligned with CLIP) to extract per-pixel features from RGB that are fused into the map (see vlmaps/map/vlmap_builder_cam.py: _init_lseg).
- You then “index” the map with text categories to obtain semantic layers. Example calls are in applications/create_map.py and applications/index_map.py referenced in README.

#### How to use it with Isaac Sim (no labels required)
1) Record an Isaac Sim dataset
   - For each timestep, save:
     - RGB image: rgb/000000.png, 000001.png, …
     - Depth image in meters: depth/000000.npy, 000001.npy, … (float32, shape HxW; linear meters)
     - Camera pose (prefer camera-in-world to simplify): poses.txt (one pose per frame; see README guidance)
   - Keep intrinsics K (fx, fy, cx, cy) for the camera.
   - You can generate this by attaching an RGB and a depth sensor to your Isaac camera, reading the view matrix (T_world_cam), and writing images + T_world_cam per frame.

   Directory skeleton expected (README “Application on Customized Datasets”):
   - vlmaps_data_dir/
     - your_scene_name/
       - rgb/
         - 000000.png
         - 000001.png
       - depth/
         - 000000.npy
         - 000001.npy
       - poses.txt

   Notes:
   - Isaac Sim uses a Z-up world. Make sure your saved poses and the base/camera axis settings in config match the repo’s conventions (X forward, Y left, Z up by default).

2) Configure VLMaps for your dataset
   - Set camera intrinsics in config/map_config/vlmaps.yaml (key: cam_calib_mat).
   - Set base-to-camera extrinsics and axis conventions in config/params/default.yaml (e.g., base2cam_rot, base_forward_axis, base_left_axis, base_up_axis). If you store camera poses directly (recommended), make sure these reflect how the camera relates to the robot base in Isaac.
   - Choose map resolution cs (meters per voxel) in config/params/default.yaml.
   - If your coordinate frames differ (e.g., Isaac’s camera looking -Z), adjust base2cam_rot accordingly.

3) Build the map (feature fusion)
   - Run: python applications/create_map.py
   - This consumes your RGB-D + poses to produce a fused 3D map with visual-language features. Under the hood, VLMaps uses LSeg to get per-pixel features and projects them into the voxel map using depth and poses.

4) Index the map with text (zero-shot “labels”)
   - Run: python applications/index_map.py
   - This step uses CLIP text embeddings to score each voxel and derives masks via percentile thresholding (see vlmaps/map/clip_map.py: load_categories and the 95th percentile thresholding). You can pass categories like ["chair", "table", "microwave"] to get corresponding masks without any training.

5) Use the map
   - Programmatically, you can create a CLIPMap, load your map, and call load_categories([...]) to get masks and sparse distributions for navigation or localization (see vlmaps/map/clip_map.py and vlmaps/robot/habitat_lang_robot.py for examples such as get_clip_sparse_region_distribution_map).

#### What if you truly want to “train” something?
- Not required for VLMaps, but you could optionally fine-tune the vision side for domain adaptation to Isaac Sim:
  - Use Isaac Sim’s ground-truth semantic/instance labels to fine-tune LSeg or a CLIP-aligned pixel encoder. This repo doesn’t include fine-tuning code; start with zero-shot first and only consider adaptation if performance is insufficient.
  - Alternatively, self-supervised or synthetic-caption pipelines are possible, but they are outside this repo’s scope.

#### Important repo bits referenced
- Zero-shot CLIP text scoring and thresholding: vlmaps/map/clip_map.py (init CLIP and load_categories)
- LSeg feature extraction: vlmaps/map/vlmap_builder_cam.py (_init_lseg)
- Custom dataset path + steps: README “Application on Customized Datasets”, including running applications/create_map.py and applications/index_map.py
- Pose conversions (if you later integrate live): vlmaps/dataloader/habitat_dataloader.py
- Utilities for saving/loading sparse CLIP maps: vlmaps/utils/mapping_utils.py

#### Caveats when coming from Isaac Sim
- There’s no built-in Isaac Sim dataloader in this repo; follow the “custom dataset” path described above. Make sure:
  - Depth is in meters and aligned with RGB.
  - Poses in poses.txt correspond exactly to the frames and to the camera used to render RGB/depth.
  - The extrinsic base2cam_rot and axis settings match your pose convention. A mismatched convention is the most common cause of warped maps.
- Tuning:
  - cs (voxel size): 0.05–0.10 m is a reasonable starting range.
  - clip_version: defaults to "ViT-B/32" (see clip_map.py); you can try ViT-L/14 if you have GPU memory.
  - Thresholding: change percentile if masks are too sparse or too dense.

#### Search note
- I looked through this repo for “Isaac/isaac” and didn’t find a built-in integration; you’ll need the “customized dataset” path. Results may be incomplete due to search limits. You can browse more here:
  - https://github.com/vlmaps/vlmaps/search?q=isaac

If helpful, I can sketch a small Isaac Sim export script (RGB, depth in meters, T_world_cam, intrinsics K) and a validator to check that your poses/intrinsics/extrinsics reconstruct a point cloud correctly before running VLMaps.


## 2. Question
can i also load a model and run it locally? because for this i need a hugging face api.

## 2. Answere
Yes — you can run VLMaps fully locally without any Hugging Face API.

#### What the repo uses
- CLIP: via the openai-clip Python package (clip.load in vlmaps/map/clip_map.py). It downloads weights once to a local cache and then runs offline. No HF API needed.
- LSeg checkpoint: downloaded once via gdown in vlmaps/map/vlmap_builder_cam.py. If you’re offline, just place the checkpoint file manually.

#### How to run completely offline
1) Install deps locally (no API needed)
- Python 3.8–3.10 recommended
- pip install: torch, torchvision, openai-clip, numpy, opencv-python, omegaconf, scipy, gdown, etc. (or use conda)

2) Pre-download/copy model weights to disk
- CLIP weights:
  - clip.load("ViT-B/32", download_root="/path/to/models/clip") will look there first; if the weights are already present, it won’t try to fetch them.
  - First-time weight fetch requires internet just once; alternatively, copy the .pt files into that folder beforehand.
- LSeg checkpoint:
  - Expected path: <repo_root>/vlmaps/lseg/checkpoints/demo_e200.ckpt
  - If offline, manually place demo_e200.ckpt there. Otherwise the code will auto-download with gdown on first run.

3) Tell CLIP to use your local cache
- The code in clip_map.py calls clip.load(self.clip_version) directly. You can keep it as-is if you’ve already cached the model in the default cache (~/.cache/clip). Otherwise, you can set the download_root by modifying that call or pre-populating the default cache.

#### Minimal examples

- Prefetch script (optional: run while you have internet)
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Set your local model cache
CLIP_DIR="${CLIP_DIR:-/opt/models/clip}"
LSEG_DIR="${LSEG_DIR:-$(pwd)/vlmaps/lseg/checkpoints}"

mkdir -p "$CLIP_DIR" "$LSEG_DIR"

# 1) CLIP models (example: ViT-B/32). This command needs internet once.
# After this, you can run fully offline as long as you keep the files.
python - <<'PY'
import clip, torch
model, preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/32", device="cpu", download_root="${CLIP_DIR}")
print("CLIP ViT-B/32 cached.")
PY

# 2) LSeg checkpoint (will download to repo checkpoints folder). Needs internet once.
# If you are offline, copy demo_e200.ckpt to $LSEG_DIR manually.
python - <<'PY'
import os, torch, sys
from pathlib import Path
checkpoint_dir = Path("vlmaps/lseg/checkpoints").resolve()
checkpoint_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
ckpt = checkpoint_dir / "demo_e200.ckpt"
if not ckpt.exists():
    import gdown
    url = "https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1ayk6NXURI_vIPlym16f_RG3ffxBWHxvb"
    print("Downloading LSeg checkpoint...")
    gdown.download(url, output=str(ckpt))
else:
    print("LSeg checkpoint already present.")
print("Done.")
PY

echo "All set. Keep ${CLIP_DIR} and ${LSEG_DIR} for offline runs."
```

- Load CLIP strictly from a local folder
```python
import clip, torch
model, preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/32", device="cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu", download_root="/opt/models/clip")
model.eval()
```

- Using CLIPMap locally
```python
from omegaconf import OmegaConf
from vlmaps.map.clip_map import CLIPMap

cfg = OmegaConf.load("config/map_config/vlmaps.yaml")
m = CLIPMap(map_dir="/path/to/your/built_map_dir", map_config=cfg)  # loads CLIP and your map
m.load_categories(["chair","table","microwave"])  # zero-shot, no labels
contours, centers, bboxes = m.get_pos("chair")
```

##### Notes and pitfalls
- No Hugging Face API is required anywhere in this repo. If you prefer, you could swap in transformers’ CLIP, but the code already works with openai-clip.
- First-time downloads: CLIP weights and LSeg checkpoint need to be present locally. After that, everything runs offline.
- If you’re fully air‑gapped, manually place:
  - CLIP weights under the download_root you will use (or ~/.cache/clip).
  - LSeg checkpoint at vlmaps/lseg/checkpoints/demo_e200.ckpt.
- Ensure your dataset (RGB, depth in meters, poses) is in the “customized dataset” format described in the README, then run:
  - python applications/create_map.py
  - python applications/index_map.py

If you want, I can adapt clip_map.py to force a custom local download_root for CLIP so it never attempts to hit the network.
